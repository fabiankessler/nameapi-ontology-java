Contains domain classes for remote method calls to the NameAPI Servers.


<h1>What is it?</h1>
This software contains the domain classes (entities and their relations) that are used in remote method
calls (such as soap web services) to transfer information from the client application to the server
(onoserver application) and back. It is the common vocabulary.
The java web services use these on the server-side, and thus the java client uses the same.

<h2>Definition of the term "ontology"</h2>
An ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization.
For further information see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology and http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Ontology



<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
Example code:
<pre><code>
Person person = new SimpleNaturalPersonBuilder(
    new PersonNameBuilder().add(givenName("John")).add(surname("Doe")).build()
    ).addTitle("Dr.")
    .setGender(StoragePersonGender.MALE)
    .setAgeInfo(new BirthYear(1950))
    .addAddressForAll(new StandardAddressBuilder()
        .setPostalCode("90210")
        .setPlaceName("Beverly Hills")
        .setStreetInfo(new StreetNameAndNumber("Hill road", "512"))
        .setCountry("US")
    .build())
.build();
</code></pre>

<h2>Use Builders</h2>
Instead of constructing objects manually with complicated constructors where fields may be <code>null</code>,
check if there is a builder class available. The constructor of the class to build should say so.
Note that the <code>build()</code> method usually throws IllegalStateException to prevent the creation of
empty objects.


<h2>Multiple interface implementations</h2>
The developer is sometimes presented with multiple choices; multiple implementations exist for a general interface.
An example is the InputAddress with the SingleStringAddress and the StructuredAddress implementations.


<h2>Null and Guava Optional</h2>
This project avoids null, and uses the Optional from the Guava library instead.<br/>
See http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Optional.html

<h2>Exceptions and their handling</h2>
The concept of this library is to throw exceptions in response to developer mistakes, but not as a result
of bad data.<br/>
Example: <code>new BirthDate("1986", "0", "31")</code> throws an IllegalArgumentException because the
javadoc clearly specifies that the month must be 1-12.<br/>
However, <code>new BirthDate("1986", "2", "31")</code> does not throw even though the date is invalid.
The BirthDate object is a POJO and doesn't have that much logic built in; it is the task of a validation
service to report bad data on that level.<br/>
Other exceptions to expect in response to programming errors are IllegalStateExceptions, for example when
calling the same setter twice in a builder class.<br/>
It is possible that exceptions thrown by this library occur for the first time in production. That's the
case when such a situation did not occur while testing. Hence the developer should always consider the
fact that this library may throw a RuntimeException.


<h2>Null and empty values</h2>
Whether <code>null</code> values are permitted is documented and enforced using the @NotNull and
@Nullable annotations. Passing in <code>null</code> as a parameter annotated with @NotNull causes
an IllegalArgumentException.
For further information see http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/howto.html<br/>
Whether empty String values are permitted depends on a case by case basis, and should be documented.
Passing in an empty string to a method that does not allow it causes an IllegalArgumentException.
This library does not trim String input values. It is the task of the developer to hand in trimmed
strings. Hence it is possible to pass in a whitespace string where an empty string would cause
an Exception - this is not the way it's meant to be used.<br/>
