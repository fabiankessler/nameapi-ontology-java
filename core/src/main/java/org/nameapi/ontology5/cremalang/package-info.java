/**
 * COPY-PASTED ON 2014-08-28 FROM CREMA-LANG
 *
 *
 *
 * This package is copied and moved here (under a different class path) because otherwise a
 * library/app that includes both ontology and crema-lang might include the classes from here
 * instead of the original library.
 *
 * That would be bad because the classes from this package might be outdated and conflicts can occur
 * at runtime because of 2 different versions of the classes on the classpath.
 *
 * Also, we don't want the dependency.
 *
